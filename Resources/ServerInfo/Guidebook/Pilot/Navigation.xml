  # Navigation

  As a Pilot, your main objectives are to:
  - safely move your crew from point A to point B
  - choose which warp point to visit
  - follow orders from the captain

  ## Warp Points
  In order to travel the stars, the shuttle console gets 2-6 warp points. These warp points have a 4 letter tag that allow you to see what it is quickly.

  - [color=#a4885c]????[/color], is an unsurveyed warp point. There may, or may not, be something there.
  - [color=#a4885c]BASE[/color] or the name of the outpost, indicates a trade station/outpost, which your crew may be able to perform cargo duties at.
  - [color=#a4885c]!!!![/color], is a confirmed threat warp point. There is a confirmed danger in that zone.
  - [color=#a4885c]PLNT[/color], indicates that there is a planet within range you can visit.
  - [color=#a4885c]MOON[/color], is a rocky destination with unknown dangers and unknown rewards. Visit at your own risk.
  - [color=#a4885c]STAR[/color], is a confirmed safe star, there will be no dangers. This will be a good place to relax.
  - [color=#a4885c]RUIN[/color], is a confirmed ruin, and there may be something you can get out of the wreck.
  - [color=#a4885c]VOID[/color], is an abyss. May god save your souls should you pick this destination.

  ## Universal Galactic Directions

  The equivalent of cardinal directions in space is the galactic directions. There are four of these galactic directions. [color=#a4885c]Coreward[/color] is pointing toward the center of the galaxy, while [color=#a4885c]Rimward[/color] points outward from the center of the galaxy. These are the equivalents of North and South. [color=#a4885c]Spinward[/color] is the direction of the galactic's spin, while [color=#a4885c]Trailing[/color] is the opposite. These two directions represent East and West. When all four of these directions are used, it can be quite useful for uncalibrated nav systems should pilots or navigators have to pilot their ships manually.
